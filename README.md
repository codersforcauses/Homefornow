# Basic skeleton code for now it won't run, just to show you structure of app

# anglicare-sprint-week
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO

## Getting started
* `git clone https://github.com/noobling/anglicare-sprint-week.git`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## TODO
1. Become familiar with main technologies `express/mongoDB/mongoose` you can learn HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT but your time would be more efficiently spent learning the framework 
2. Become proficient enough to fix this broken app
3. Break down problem into components/functions e.g. authentication, admin form for vacancies, page for vancancies, landing page, schemas etc.
4. Start building your component function!

## I hope you guys have fun and learn a bunch from this :) ~David
